You’re probably reading this because someone sent you a protected document and you clicked the sign in link in the email message, or your favorite search engine sent you here.

Microsoft Rights Management (RMS) helps the sender of a document protect it from people who do not need to see it, or should not see it. The sender specifies who can access the document, and what they can do with it (for example, view only, print, etc).

## Quick start
To view a protected document, you must sign in and have a supported application:

1. Sign in [here](https://portal.aadrm.com/) to get a free RMS account. If your company already has RMS, we’ll let you know.

2. Download the RMS application for your device by selecting the right icon on [this page](http://portal.aadrm.com/home/download). For Windows computers, you must be a local administrator (current limitation).

That’s it. You’re now ready to open protected files. Just go back to the original email and open the attachment.

> [!NOTE]
> In your email, you might see two files of the same name. They are the same except that one of them is a protected PDF file (.ppdf file name extension) that you can open on all platforms when you use our free RMS sharing application. To open the protected Office file, you must use an application that supports RMS. Currently, this means Office 2013 or Office 2010 running on Windows. Future versions of Office on mobile platforms will support RMS. Keep informed about updates via [@TheRMSGuy](https://twitter.com/TheRMSGuy).
