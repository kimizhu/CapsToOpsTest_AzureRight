# Scenario - Share an Office File with Users in Another Organization
This scenario and supporting user documentation uses Azure Rights Management so that users can safely email an Office file with people in another organization. For example, the Office file might be a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or PowerPoint presentation that contains  price list information for a partner, a list of products for a reseller, or a list of delivery time lines with potential customers.  When users follow the instructions, the file attached to the email message will be protected by Azure Rights Management.

This scenario is suitable for the following set of circumstances:

- The employee has to send information outside the organization, via email, in the form of an Office document attachment.

- The document contains information that is not public, but is not exclusively for internal use.

- The recipient users do not have a requirement to further share this information with others, print it, or use it as part of their own documentation. If this is not the case, you can change the user instructions from selecting view-only permissions to another option that permits the recipient to change the attachment.

- The employee is potentially interested in knowing when this document is opened by the external user.

## User Documentation Instructions
Using the following template, copy and paste the user instructions into a communication for your end users, and make these modifications to reflect your environment:

1. Replace *&lt;name of Office document type&gt;* with the type of document that your users will be sending.  Use wording that is specific and familiar to their work flows, such as "price list", "delivery times", and "bid proposal" rather than "Word document" and "Excel spreadsheet". This more specific wording helps to increases the likelihood that they will follow the instructions when working with those documents.

2. Replace *&lt;contact details&gt;* with instructions for how your users can contact the help desk, such as a website link, email address, or telephone number.

3. **Additional modifications you might want to make:**

   - In step 2, we suggest **Viewer - View Only** for the permissions, which makes the attached document (but not the original) read-only for the recipients. If this restriction is not suitable for your business requirement, change this option for another set of permissions, such as **Reviewer - View and Edit**.

   - In step 3, we suggest **Allow me to instantly revoke access to these documents** so that there is no delay if your users revoke the document later, but setting this option requires the recipient to always have an Internet connection to open the attachment. This step also requires you to have a subscription that supports document tracking and revocation. Delete this step if it is not suitable for your users.

   - In step 4, we suggest the option **Email me when somebody tries to open this document**. If users track their documents by using the document tracking portal, you might decide that email notification is not necessary and delete this step.

   - The steps do not include setting an expiration date. If the information should not be used after a specific date, add another step to set an appropriate expiration time, such as 90 days from sending the email message.

   > [!NOTE]
   > For more information about each of the options that users can select, see [Dialog box options for the Rights Management sharing application](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn574738.aspx)

4. Make any other modifications that you want to this set of instructions, and then send it to these users.

The example documentation shows how these instructions might look for users, after your customizations.
